#  Headsterter Summer 2022 Company Case Project - Resume Parser

The need is to build a resume parser for companies to upload the applicants' resumes to the website and sort the resume based on specific keywords.

I built a full-stack React-Express resume parser including a file uploading feature and a keyword searching feature. The HTTPS requests are handled by React-Axios API

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for server and client
npm install
cd client
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm run dev
```
