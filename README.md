#  Headsterter Summer 2022 Company Case Project - Resume Parser

The need is to builda resume parser for companies to upload the applicants' resumes to the website and sort the resume based on specific keywords.

I buit a full-stack React-Express resume parser including a file uploading feature and a keyword searching feature.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for server and client
npm install
cd client
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm run dev
```
